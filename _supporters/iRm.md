### Setup

The computer running Artisan must be on the same IP network as the roaster. The default IP address of the roaster is 10.100.0.15. Configure your computer to use a static IP address in the range of the roaster (10.100.0.x) but with x different from that of the roaster (eg. 10.100.0.42). Choose 255.255.255.0 as subnet mask. 
 
This can be done on Windows using the Network Sharing Center by adding a TCP/IPv4 Local Area Connection with those properties. On macOS you set your ethernet port in the Network Control panel to "IPv4: Manually" and fill in the IP and subnet mask accordingly.

**Watch out!** Artisan doesn't monitor unsafe temperatures, so you should never leave the roaster alone.
